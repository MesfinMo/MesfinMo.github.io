title: About this blog

This blog is primarily to document and share some of the things I find interesting while working on projects. Most of the time, after figuring out about some issue by reading other blogs or doing some research on the internet, I forget how I solved it in the first place when I later am faced with the same situation, (ohh that happens a lot).  I am sure I will be using the content for myself as a reference and hopefully someone else will find it useful too. 

I will appreciate and greatly receive any comment you may have.
